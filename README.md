# Hardcaml MIPS CPU

Hi! We are Sasha Skvortsov and Mayur Deshpande. As a followup to a class project, we are designing a simple 5-stage MIPS CPU in OCaml via the [HardCaml](https://github.com/janestreet/hardcaml) library. You can read more about this project at the [CeramicHacker](https://ceramichacker.com/t/hardcaml-mips) blog.

## Code Structure

There are 3 main components to this codebase:

- In `lib`: source code for the MIPS CPU
- In `test`: Unit and integration tests for the MIPS CPU
- In the project root: a `main.ml` file that prints the design from `lib` into Verilog

## How to Use
