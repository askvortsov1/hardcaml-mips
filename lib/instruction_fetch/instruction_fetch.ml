(*
In an actual computer, instruction memory would be actual memory,
and we would use Hardcaml's `multiport_memory` primitive to implement it.

Unfortunately, that primitive doesn't support initial values, so testing would
require either a complex sequence of `reset` logic or a physical RAM device.

The former would be messy and the latter beyond the scope of this project,
but we still don't want to hardcode a particular program as part of the design.
Instead, to keep things simple, we consider the program to be an input to the construction of our circuit.
